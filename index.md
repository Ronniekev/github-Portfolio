#### About me

I’m Kevin Penate, a Computer Science undergrad at Oregon State University, graduating in late 2025. I got into coding because I love solving problems, and that drive hasn’t slowed down. Every project I take on teaches me something new, and I’m always looking for the next challenge.

Before diving into CS, I worked in biotech manufacturing and aerospace technical planning. Those roles taught me a lot about precision, collaboration, and working in fast paced, technical environments—skills I bring with me into every coding project.

I’m looking for an entry level/junior software engineering role where I can grow my skillset, contribute to a team, and keep learning every day.

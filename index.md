### Welcome to my CS portfolio!

#### About me

My name is Kevin Penate, I'm an Oregon State University Computer Science Undergrad with an expected graduation date early 2026. 
I began coding to solve problems and continue learning with every new problem I tackle. I aspire to find a role that allows me
to leverage my skills and fosters an environment where improvement and learning is an everyday practice.

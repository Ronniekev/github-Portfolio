Hi, I'm Kevin Penate, a passionate full-stack developer and Computer Science undergrad at Oregon State University, graduating in late 2025.

I got into coding because I love solving problems, and that drive hasnâ€™t slowed down. Every project I take on teaches me something new, and Iâ€™m always looking for the next challenge.

Before entering tech, I worked in biotech manufacturing and aerospace technical planning, where I developed precision, team collaboration, and the ability to navigate fast-paced environmentsâ€”skills that now shape my engineering approach.

I'm currently seeking an **entry level/ junior software engineering role** where I can grow, contribute, and continue learning every day.
